    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Here at Care Ties we are dedicated to our local community here in Pittsburgh. We believe that we can improve the lives of indivuals by provinding fun, quality hair scrucnchies, but more importantly we can support those who are suffering due to domestic violence by helping to provide for thier physical, mental, and emotional needs through our partnering organization, Women's Center &amp; Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. We donate 10% of our profits to this cause with the hope that we can help those who are currently in need, and prevent these issues in the futrue. When you purchase our schrunties you are supporting this mission. Thank You!
